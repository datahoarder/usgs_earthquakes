columns:
  id:
    type: String
    description: |
      A (generally) two-character network identifier with a (generally) eight-character network-assigned code. A unique identifier for the event. This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time. See the "ids" GeoJSON format property.
    examples:
      - usp000jnek
      - ak11620427

  time:
    type: DateTime
    description: Time when the event occurred to the millisecond. Does not include leap seconds.
    time_format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"
    nullable: false

  latitude:
    type: Float
    length: [8,5]

  longitude:
    type: Float
    length: [8,5]

  depth:
    type: Float
    length: [5,1]
    description: Depth of the event in kilometers.

  mag:
    type: Float
    length: [3,1]
    description: The magnitude of the event

  magType:
    type: String
    description: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event.
    examples:
      - Md
      - Ml
      - Ms
      - Mw
      - Me
      - Mi
      - Mb
      - MLg
  nst:
    type: Integer
    length: 5
    description: "The total number of Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake."

  gap:
    type: Float
    length: [4, 1]
    description: |
      The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake.

  dmin:
    type: Float
    length: [4, 1]
    description: |
      Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees). 1 degree is approximately 111.2 kilometers. In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated depth of the earthquake.

  rms:
    type: Float
    length: [6, 2]
    description: |
      The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data. The value is dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used to compute the earthquake location, the quality weights assigned to the arrival time data, and the procedure used to locate the earthquake.
  net:
    type: String
    length: 5
    description: |
      The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.
    examples: [ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw]

  updated:
    type: DateTime
    description: Time when the event occurred to the millisecond. Does not include leap seconds.
    time_format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"
    nullable: false

  place:
    type: String
    description: |
      Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.
    examples:
      - "South of the Fiji Islands"
      - "23km WSW of Willow, Alaska"
  type:
    type: String
    description: Type of seismic event.
    examples:
      - earthquake
      - quarry
